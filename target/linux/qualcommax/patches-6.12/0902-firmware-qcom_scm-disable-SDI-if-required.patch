Subject: firmware: qcom_scm: disable SDI if required

IPQ5018 has SDI (Secure Debug Image) enabled by TZ by default, and that
means that WDT being asserted or just trying to reboot will hang the board
in the debug mode and only pulling the power and repowering will help.
Some IPQ4019 boards like Google WiFI have it enabled as well.

Luckily, SDI can be disabled via an SCM call.

So, lets use the boolean DT property to identify boards that have SDI
enabled by default and use the SCM call to disable SDI during SCM probe.
It is important to disable it as soon as possible as we might have a WDT
assertion at any time which would then leave the board in debug mode,
thus disabling it during SCM removal is not enough.
